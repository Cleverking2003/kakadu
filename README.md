### Fast as flying bird!

At present, OS contains of:
- Bootloader (Initial loading stuff)
- Kernel (Work with system etc.)
- Core library (like C std library, with some stuff needed for kernel)

## Build and usage
> Warning: At present, this OS in development state! We do not recommend to use it on actual PC. (Or use it at your own risk)

To build OS yourself you need:
- Make
- GCC
- LD
- NASM

To initiate build you need to run `make`.  
Note that `make` outputs just pure binary, (if you want) you can create disk image yourself.
If you want a debug build, use `make DEBUG=1`

After this, you can run Kakadu on emulator (x86_64). For development and testing we recommend you to use `QEMU`. In `scripts` folder you can find out scripts for running `QEMU` with and without `GDB`.
